This project is about detecting stress based upon a different health attributes of the person. The algorithms used for this project is Decision Trees and Random Forest. 
The dataset consists of details about a patient including timestamp of when they get stressed, their heart reate and respiratory and a binary label for stressed or not stressed.
The code consists of some exploratory data analysis done, dataset slitting into training-validation-testing. 
The implementation of the algorithm is done using Scikit learn and the metrics used is classification report.
